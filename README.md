# Titanic_survival_prediction

Overview


This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the RMS Titanic based on various factors such as passenger class, sex, age, and other relevant variables. The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains information about passengers who boarded the Titanic along with their survival status.


Dataset


The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which is widely used in machine learning and data science competitions. The dataset contains 891 rows and 12 columns, including variables such as passenger class, sex, age, and survival status.


Methodology


The approach used for this project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers. Relevant features were engineered to improve the model's performance. Finally, a logistic regression model was trained and tested using the training and testing sets.


Results


The model achieved an accuracy of 80.45% on the testing set, indicating a good performance in predicting the survival of Titanic passengers.


Conclusion


This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The results show that the model is effective in identifying the factors that influence survival outcomes. This project can be extended by exploring other machine learning algorithms and techniques to improve the model's performance. This README file provides a brief overview of the project, including the dataset used, methodology, results, and conclusion. It serves as a starting point for anyone interested in exploring the project further.
